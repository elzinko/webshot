# Puppeteer Vercel

Welcome! This repository demonstrates how to use puppeteer on vercel with browserless. [For more information visit our blog post here](https://www.browserless.io/blog/2023/03/21/puppeteer-vercel). You'll need a browserless API token in order for this to work properly which you can get by [signing up here](https://www.browserless.io/sign-up-cloud-unit/).

Our code for this project is in `src/pages/api/webshot.ts` and in the `env.local` -- everything else is left untouched from the initial install! README including starting below


- create a [cloud browserless](https://cloud.browserless.io/) account.
- copy API key and create a .env.local file with it :

```env
# Browserless Token
BLESS_TOKEN=xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx-xxxxx
```

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/webshot](http://localhost:3000/api/webshot). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
